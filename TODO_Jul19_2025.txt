Prompt for PS script:

Help me improve this wrestling game on BGA. I will tell you specifically what I want to work on. The files Game.php and material.inc.php are in subdirectory modules\php. The others are in the top.

When you make changes, ensure you don't introduce syntax errors. Be careful and precise.

For changes, create a safe PowerShell script to modify files. Use simple regex patterns and avoid complex string interpolation. Make small incremental changes rather than replacing large code blocks.

For example:
1. Avoid Complex String Interpolation. Don't Do This: '$replacement = "some text with $variable and ${complex} stuff"'
2. Escape Variables in Regex Carefully. Don't Do This: '$content = $content -replace "pattern with $variable", "replacement with $1"'
3. Use Simple Regex Patterns. Do this: '$content -replace 'name" => "firstPlayerTurn"', 'name" => "cardSelection"'
4. Test Here-Strings Carefully.
5. Use Incremental Replacements.
6. Use only UTF-8 without BOM

"Use simple regex patterns only"
"Avoid complex variable interpolation"
"Make incremental changes rather than large block replacements"
"Test each here-string syntax carefully"
"Use string concatenation instead of interpolation when mixing variables and literal text"
